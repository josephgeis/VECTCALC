# Vector Calculator
This is a vector addition program I made about a year ago for my TI-84 Plus CE written in C++. It utilizes the [CE Programming C Toolchain](https://ce-programming.github.io/).

I was curious about making programs for the TI-84 Plus CE in C, so this was my first endeavor into it. I learned a lot about how C/C++ memory management, pointers, and arrays all work.

I probably couldn't tell you what my code does now as I haven't touched this project in months and I don't use C++ on a day-to-day basis.
